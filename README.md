This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of various studies examining the impact of food prices across different subgroups.
# Variable Subgroup Analysis of Food Price Impact Studies

The analysis includes effect sizes, confidence intervals, heterogeneity measures, and more, categorized by continent, income level, time horizon, study design, weather events, agricultural production, GDP, and quality score of studies.


## Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand how food prices affect different populations and regions, taking into account various factors such as income levels, geographical locations, and study designs. This information is crucial for policymakers and researchers aiming to address food security and economic stability.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Subgroup**: Categories such as continent, income level, time horizon, study design, weather events, agricultural production, GDP, and quality score.
- **Effect Size**: The estimated effect size of food price changes on the respective subgroup.
- **Confidence Intervals (95% CI)**: The lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals for the effect sizes.
- **I²**: A measure of heterogeneity among studies within each subgroup.
- **Heterogeneity P-value**: The p-value indicating the significance of heterogeneity between groups.

## Visualizations

Visualizations of the data include:

- Bar charts showing effect sizes and confidence intervals for each subgroup.
- Forest plots to compare effect sizes across categories.
- Heatmaps to illustrate heterogeneity (I² values) across different subgroups.
